# Deception Detection
A system to differentiate fake and genuine reviews on the basis of sentimental and syntactic features using different machine learning and neural network based approaches

### Approaches Explored

- Using naive bayes approach and all the words as features: ~ 48 % [link][1]
- Using navie bayes approach and tf-idf over words as features: ~ 50 % [link][2]
- Using support vector machines and tf-idf over words as features: ~51 % [link][3]
- Using SVM with n-gram tf-idf over Part of Speech: ~56 %
